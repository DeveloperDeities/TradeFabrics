Problem Statement

What do we want to create?

 A smartphone application,Which on further development may add web application

What is our idea about?

This project aims to develop online shopping for customers with the goal that it is very easy to shop your loved things from an extensive number of merchants available on the web .On further development may convert into  a app plus and a website Where people who are manufacturers of different clothes on different scale  can come together and sell their products on the single platform which allows them to have a hassle-free payment as well as good selling of the product.With the help of this buyers can carry out an online shopping from home. Here is no compelling reason to go to the crowded stores or shopping centers during and after lockdown . You simply require a mobile or a laptop and one important payment sending option to shop online or to sell .To get to this online shopping system all the users will need to have an email and password to login and proceed your shopping . The login credentials for an online shopping system are under high security and nobody will have the capacity to crack it easily.Upon successful login the customers can purchase a wide range of fabrics such as Arganj Shalabh fabric,Butter Crepe Nylon,Chanderi Buti Fabric,Handloom Tussar Pure Silk Fabric etc. can be dispatched using an online shopping system. And of course you will get your requested ordered items at your door step.It is simple. You will pick your favourite items from a variety of online merchants looking at cost and quality. No need to go physical shops with this you will have more time to spend with your family.It Just need a mobile and a payment making options like net banking,credit card, debit card or online wallets.Almost a wide range of things can be brought through online shopping system.You can purchase goods from foreign places from your bedroom and you will get your goods at your home.It is extremely secure. Customer service is accessible.
Many online shopping which allows to sell different types of things at a single place but this app is mainly focused on a single product fabrics because it has been seen that many merchants are facing problem while selling these online as people who are willing to buy direct fabrics for readymade clothes but they fail as three is no online platform for particularly this work. There are a vast number of merchants other merchants who are in the work of converting fabrics to clothes needed this app or a website so that they could also buy fabrics online and could expand the business a bit faster rather than to buy fabrics physically going to manufacturers of fabrics.
Something that makes the project different is that we would be not selling readymade clothes other than that we would be selling fabrics which would be made directly from machines then after that people would buy them and use them to make Sherwani and clothes like kurta etc.
We would have 2 options for the user to login either as merchant or as customer/buyer where merchants would be able to list the item to sell and customers would buy them.
 every merchant would be allowed to request for verification by the admin where the people who are DBA are allowed to assign them either verified or non verified merchants which would help the buyer to know and to be sure where to buy products from.
In addition to this we would charge a very  small amount of commission from both the clients.
And the main highlight would be that the amount we would earn no matter what 50% of it would be given to charity every year and the same will be displayed to all the users for their contribution made.

Has the idea/project been implemented by someone else in the past?
 
Yes,we have seen many online websites and apps selling things online and similar to them we also aim to sell our goods online as well as of other merchants that are willing to sell their products online. For example: amazon, flipkart , indiamart etc. most important feature of our app is “its only for Fabrics ,not for any other items.As there is no applications till now which is selling fabrics. All of them are selling readymade items.But there are no facilities for the people who want to buy fabrics. Releasing this application we can make an end to this problem.”











Literature Review 

Our application is basically based on online shopping where people can order from their home their desired things.But these kinds of applications have already been given by established companies like AMAZON, FLIPKART etc .There are also various other well known companies who have implemented the same.
In all the shopping apps ,there are various users all over the world. Each of them will have an ID and password for login. After successful  login the user can freely find  his desired  item.After selecting the item the person has to go for the payment process via any means.After successful payment the user will be given a specific date within which the item will be delivered. This is the complete concept of an online shopping application.
Our app will be similar to that.But there are some changes which will make it unique.The first and the most important feature of our app is “its only for Fabrics ,not for any other items.As there is no applications till now which is selling fabrics. All of them are selling readymade items.But there are no facilities for the people who want to buy fabrics. Releasing this application we can make an end to this problem.”
Second important uniqueness is “this application is both user and seller friendly.Seller can very easily put their Fabrics with all the required data with it.According to the users requirement the data will be shown to the screen.”







this would be the login page of our project and there would be a signup button too .where different users can sign up according to the choice that weather they want to be merchant or buyer.But login page will be same for all and once logged in users will have a choice selection for which role they wanna log in but in buyers case he can only log in as buyer on the other hand seller can act as both.
this is how the registration page would look like but with more fields and before registration a choice selection will take place asking for which rolo user wants to sign up/register for normal users this much info is ok but for merchants there would be more columns for bank details.
After login the particular user this would be a role selection page after the login in which only merchants can select both options after successful registration/authentication but buyers/normal users can only select buyers image i.e. to buy only not to sell.(the top img is for buyers and bottom one is for merchants).
this would be the check out page where invoice generation will take place for buyer and he would get the required amount to be paid
this would be the catalog viewing for the buyers where they can select the fabric according to their choice i.e which color or type of fabric etc they want.
There will also be a page for forget password by which a user can change his or her  password. By requesting a reset password link on their registered mail id.

So after all these, all the items which are put up by all the sellers will be visible to the users in the proper list.He or she just has to search for the item and proceed for the payment.

USE CASE DIAGRAM:

 

Scope:
Online shopping is rising day by day in India. Because India is the country where computer user's are increasing day by day so the online shopping trends are also increasing.This project contains selling of online fabrics by various merchants for buyers by showing users different items and categories for fabrics which they may like and buy.As there are huge no of people who are merchants who first buys fabrics and converts them to wearables and sells them, this app is basically targeted for them only.As for now there is no such app and can be of huge success.
